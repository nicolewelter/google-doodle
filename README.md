# 1920's cartoon Google Doodle
The theme for my Google Doodle is 1920’s cartoons. By gathering inspiration from other 1920’s styled art I was able to create two devilish monsters. The two monsters are meant to have a cute little crush on each other. There movements are meant to resemble those of an actual cartoon for the 1920’s, with slightly choppy movments that help show their emotions.
